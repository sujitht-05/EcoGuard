# 🌍 EcoGuard – Smart Environmental Monitoring & Decision Support System

## 📌 Project Overview

**EcoGuard** is a web-based smart environmental monitoring and decision-support dashboard designed to analyse multiple environmental parameters and provide meaningful insights about environmental conditions.

The system combines **air quality, acoustic noise, weather conditions, environmental risk, AI-based forecasting, anomaly detection, geospatial hotspot analysis, station comparison, impact simulation, personal exposure analysis, and smart environmental alerts** into a single interactive dashboard.

The main objective of EcoGuard is to transform environmental data into understandable visual insights and actionable information for better environmental awareness and decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Monitor environmental conditions through a centralized dashboard
* Analyse air-quality parameters and AQI
* Monitor acoustic noise pollution
* Study the relationship between weather and pollution
* Forecast future environmental conditions
* Detect abnormal pollution spikes
* Identify probable causes of environmental anomalies
* Compare environmental conditions across monitoring stations
* Visualize environmental hotspots geographically
* Simulate the impact of traffic and industrial changes
* Estimate personal environmental exposure risk
* Generate smart environmental alerts
* Support data-driven environmental decision-making

---

# ❗ Problem Statement

Environmental conditions can vary significantly between different locations and time periods.

Traditional monitoring systems may present raw environmental measurements without providing an integrated view of:

* Air pollution
* Noise pollution
* Weather influence
* Pollution trends
* Environmental risk
* Pollution anomalies
* Location-based hotspots
* Personal exposure
* Possible future conditions

This makes it difficult for users to understand the overall environmental situation and take appropriate action.

**EcoGuard** addresses this challenge by providing a unified environmental analytics and decision-support dashboard.

It displays important indicators such as:

* Air Quality Index (AQI)
* Acoustic noise level
* Weather conditions
* Combined environmental risk
* AQI trends
* Pollution contributing factors
* Pollution persistence prediction

The dashboard also provides a 24-hour AQI trend with an AI forecast extension.

---

## 2. 🌫️ Air Quality Monitoring

The Air Quality module provides detailed analysis of particulate matter and gaseous pollutants.

It includes:

* PM2.5
* PM10
* AQI
* Pollutant measurements
* Pollutant comparison with safe standards
* Pollution contributing factors
* Air-quality visualizations

The system presents pollutant information through interactive charts for easier interpretation.

---

## 3. 🔊 Noise Pollution Monitoring

EcoGuard includes a dedicated **Acoustic Noise Pollution Monitor**.

Features include:

* Live acoustic dB level
* Noise status classification
* Decibel spectrum visualization
* 24-hour noise timeline
* Noise threshold monitoring

The system provides a weather-versus-PM2.5 scatter/trend visualization to help understand the relationship between weather and particulate pollution.

---

# 5. 🤖 AI Predictions & Anomaly Spike Detection

EcoGuard includes an **AI Forecast & Spikes** module.

### 7-Day Environmental Forecast

The system provides a multi-parameter forecast covering:

* AQI
* PM2.5
* PM10
* Noise

It displays forecast information using charts and daily forecast cards.

### Anomaly Spike Detection

The system identifies environmental spike events and classifies them according to severity:

* Critical
* High
* Medium

It also provides:

* Timestamp
* Monitoring location
* Spike metric
* Observed change
* Severity
* AI-detected probable root cause
* Recommended action

This makes the system more than a simple monitoring dashboard by connecting abnormal readings with potential causes and actions.

# 8. 🎛️ Environmental Impact Simulator

The **Environmental Impact Simulator** allows users to change environmental influencing factors and observe the simulated impact.

Users can adjust parameters such as:

* Traffic volume change
* Industrial output change
* Wind speed
* Rainfall
* Green canopy

The simulator recalculates environmental indicators and displays the difference from the baseline condition.

### Example Scenarios

* Increased traffic
